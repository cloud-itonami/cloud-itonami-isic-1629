# ADR-0001: WoodCorkStrawAdvisor ⊣ Wood, Cork & Straw Products Shop Plant Operations Governor architecture

## Status

Accepted. `cloud-itonami-isic-1629` promoted from `:spec` to
`:implemented` in the `kotoba-lang/industry` registry, following the
verified fresh-scaffold protocol established by prior actors in this
fleet.

## Context

`cloud-itonami-isic-1629` publishes an OSS blueprint for wood/cork/
straw-products-shop **plant operations coordination** (production-
batch product-spec/unit-count/output-quality data logging for wooden
tools/handles, cork stoppers, and wicker/basketry items; cutting/
molding/weaving-equipment maintenance scheduling; materials-safety/
equipment-safety concern flagging; and outbound product shipment
coordination). Like every actor in this fleet, the blueprint alone is
not an implementation: this ADR records the governed-actor
architecture that promotes it to real, tested code, following the
same langgraph StateGraph + independent Governor + Phase 0->3 rollout
pattern established across the cloud-itonami fleet.

The closest domain analogs are `cloud-itonami-isic-1621` (Manufacture
of veneer sheets and wood-based panels), `cloud-itonami-isic-1622`
(Manufacture of builders' carpentry and joinery), and
`cloud-itonami-isic-1623` (Manufacture of wooden containers): all four
are back-office coordination actors for wood-processing plant
equipment with a real physical safety dimension. 1629 differs in one
structural respect that shapes this design: unlike 1621/1622/1623,
which each center on a single family of wood product manufactured on
a single kind of processing line, ISIC 1629 is explicitly a
**residual/miscellaneous class** ("manufacture of other products of
wood; manufacture of articles of cork, straw and plaiting materials")
spanning THREE distinct product families made on THREE distinct
equipment kinds: wooden tools/handles (turned on a handle-turning
lathe -- **cutting**), cork stoppers (formed on a cork-stopper molding
press -- **molding**), and wicker/basketry items (formed on a
wicker-weaving loom -- **weaving**). The central ground-truth entity
is therefore a **production batch of wood/cork/straw-product units**
(product-spec/unit-count/output-quality, the same shape as 1621's/
1622's/1623's own batch entity) moving through a **shop** with
cutting, molding, AND weaving equipment (not veneer-lathe/hot-press/
glue-spreader, or panel-saw/CNC-router/tenoning-machine, or
crate-pallet-nailer/stave-jointer equipment) -- the domain's HARD
invariant about pre-verification still applies to the SAME two
independent entity kinds (the referenced equipment unit for
maintenance scheduling, and the referenced batch for shipment
coordination), inherited unchanged from 1621's, 1622's, and 1623's own
Decision 4. Unlike 1623, this vertical has NO ISPM-15-style
international-freight-specific compliance dimension -- the residual
product range here (tool handles, cork stoppers, basketry) is not
itself a wood-packaging-material class subject to heat-treatment
phytosanitary marking, so safety-concern flagging is scoped to plain
materials-safety/equipment-safety concerns, not a domain-specific
regulatory compliance concern.

This vertical has NO pre-existing `kotoba-lang/woodcork`-style
capability library to wrap (verified: no such repo exists). This
build therefore uses self-contained domain logic — pure functions in
`woodcork.registry` (equipment/batch verification, shipment-unit-count
recompute, product-spec validation, output-quality plausibility
validation) are re-verified independently by the governor, the same
"ground truth, not self-report" discipline established across prior
actors (most directly `cloud-itonami-isic-1623`'s
`woodcontainer.registry`).

This blueprint's own `:itonami.blueprint/governor` keyword,
`:wood-cork-straw-products-shop-plant-operations-governor`, is
grep-verified UNIQUE fleet-wide (`gh search code
"wood-cork-straw-products-shop-plant-operations-governor" --owner
cloud-itonami`, zero hits before this repo was created).

## Decision

### Decision 1: Self-contained domain logic (no external wood/cork/straw capability library to wrap)

Unlike actors that delegate to pre-existing domain libraries, this
wood/cork/straw vertical has NO pre-existing capability library to
wrap. The equipment/batch-verification / shipment-unit-count /
product-spec / output-quality validation functions live as pure
functions in `woodcork.registry` and are re-verified independently by
`woodcork.governor` — the same "ground truth, not self-report"
discipline established across prior actors (most directly
`cloud-itonami-isic-1623`'s `woodcontainer.registry`).

### Decision 2: Coordination, not control — scope boundary at the back-office

This actor is **strictly back-office coordination** of wood/cork/
straw-products-shop plant operations. It does NOT:
- Control cutting, molding, or weaving equipment directly
- Make plant-safety or hazard decisions (exclusive to the human plant supervisor)
- Authorize or finalize a cutting/molding/weaving-line run

All proposals are `:effect :propose` only. The advisor proposes; the
governor validates; escalation paths funnel to human plant-supervisor
approval. This is not a replacement for the supervisor's authority —
it is a proposal-screening and documentation layer.

**CRITICAL SAFETY BOUNDARY**: wood/cork/straw-products manufacturing
is a safety-critical domain (lathe/molding-press/loom blade, pinch-
point, and repetitive-motion injury risk, and wood-dust fire/explosion
hazard). Safety-concern flagging NEVER auto-commits. All safety
concerns escalate immediately to human review.

### Decision 3: Safety-concern escalation — always human sign-off

`:flag-safety-concern` (materials-safety concern, equipment hazard)
ALWAYS escalates, never auto-commits. This is not a "low-stakes
proposal" — it is a circuit-breaker that must reach human authority.

### Decision 4: Two independent verified/registered gates (equipment AND batch), not one

Unlike a single-ground-truth-entity domain, this vertical has TWO
entity kinds each gating a different op, inherited unchanged from
`cloud-itonami-isic-1621`'s, `cloud-itonami-isic-1622`'s, and
`cloud-itonami-isic-1623`'s own Decision 4: `:schedule-maintenance`
independently verifies the referenced **equipment** unit's own
`:verified?`/`:registered?` fields; `:coordinate-shipment`
independently verifies the referenced **batch**'s own
`:verified?`/`:registered?` fields. Both are the same "shop/batch
record must be independently verified/registered before any action"
HARD invariant applied to the two distinct record kinds this domain
actually has. `:coordinate-shipment` additionally independently
recomputes whether a batch's own recorded shipped-to-date unit count
plus the proposal's own claimed unit count would exceed the batch's
own recorded production unit count — never taken on the advisor's
self-report.

### Decision 5: HARD invariants (no override)

Four HARD governor invariants (elaborated into ten concrete checks in
`woodcork.governor`, mirroring `cloud-itonami-isic-1621`'s,
`cloud-itonami-isic-1622`'s, and `cloud-itonami-isic-1623`'s own
elaboration of their HARD invariants into concrete checks) block
proposals and cannot be overridden by human approval:
1. Shop/batch record (equipment for maintenance, batch for shipment) must be independently verified/registered before any action is taken against it, and a shipment's unit count must independently recompute within the batch's own logged production unit count
2. Proposals must be `:effect :propose` only (never direct equipment control)
3. Direct cutting/molding/weaving-equipment control or cutting/molding-line-run finalization is permanently blocked
4. The op allowlist is closed — `:log-production-batch`/`:schedule-maintenance`/`:flag-safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment` only

## Consequences

(+) Wood/cork/straw-products-shop plant operations back-office now has
a documented, governed, auditable coordination layer that funnels all
decisions through independent validation before human approval.

(+) The "coordination, not control" boundary is explicit in code: all
`:effect :propose`, all real-world actuation requires human plant-
supervisor sign-off.

(+) Scope is bounded and verifiable: four HARD invariants (elaborated
into ten concrete governor checks) protect against scope creep into
unauthorized equipment operation or cutting/molding/weaving-line-run
finalization. Safety concerns are a circuit-breaker, not a threshold.

(+) Safety-critical discipline is explicit: safety-concern flagging
cannot be rate-limited, suppressed, or auto-decided by phase gate.
Human review is mandatory.

(-) Still a simulation/proposal layer, not a real plant-operations
control system. Equipment actuation and cutting/molding/weaving-line-
run execution remain human-controlled via external channels.

(-) No integration with real shop-management databases (equipment
telemetry, batch tracking, freight dispatch) — this is a standalone
coordinator blueprint.

## Verification

- `cloud-itonami-isic-1629`: `clojure -M:test` green (all tests pass;
  see the superproject ADR and `kotoba-lang/industry` registry entry
  for the exact `Ran N tests containing M assertions, 0 failures, 0
  errors` output, verified from an independent fresh clone), `clojure
  -M:lint` clean, `clojure -M:dev:run` demo runs end-to-end and
  exercises proposal submission, escalation, and every HARD-hold
  scenario directly (not-propose-effect, unknown-op,
  equipment-not-verified, batch-not-verified,
  shipment-unit-count-exceeded, cutting-molding-line-finalize-blocked,
  already-scheduled, invalid-product-spec, invalid-output-quality).
- All source is `.cljc` (portable ClojureScript / JVM / nbb) — no
  JVM-only interop; the actor graph is invoked exclusively via
  `langgraph.graph/run*` (not `.invoke`, which is not cljs-portable).
- Audit ledger is append-only, all decisions are traced; every settled
  request (commit or hold) leaves exactly one ledger fact.
- `deps.edn` pins `io.github.kotoba-lang/langgraph` and
  `io.github.kotoba-lang/langchain` via `:local/root` directly in the
  top-level `:deps` (not only under a `:dev` alias), so a bare
  `clojure -M:test` resolves offline inside the monorepo checkout.

  "Pure-function domain logic for the wood/cork/straw-products-shop
  plant-operations coordination actor -- equipment/batch verification,
  shipment-unit-count recompute, product-spec validation, output-
  quality plausibility validation, and draft maintenance-schedule/
  shipment-coordination record construction.

  Per docs/adr/0001-architecture.md Decision 1: this vertical has NO
  pre-existing `kotoba-lang/woodcork`-style capability library to wrap
  (verified: no such repo exists). The domain logic therefore lives
  here as pure functions, re-verified INDEPENDENTLY by
  `woodcork.governor` -- the same 'ground truth, not self-report'
  discipline every sibling actor's own registry establishes (e.g.
  `woodcontainer.registry/shipment-unit-count-exceeded?`,
  `millwork.registry/shipment-unit-count-exceeded?`): never trust a
  proposal's own self-reported unit-count/status when the inputs
  needed to recompute it independently are already on record.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to any real wood/cork/straw-products-shop-operations system. It
  builds the DRAFT record a plant coordinator would keep (a scheduled
  maintenance window, a coordinated shipment), not the act of
  actuating cutting/molding/weaving equipment or dispatching a real
  freight carrier (this actor NEVER does either -- see README `What
  this actor does NOT do`).")

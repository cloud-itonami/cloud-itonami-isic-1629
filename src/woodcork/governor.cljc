  "Wood, Cork & Straw Products Shop Plant Operations Governor -- the
  independent compliance layer that earns the WoodCorkStrawAdvisor the
  right to commit. The advisor has no notion of whether a piece of
  equipment it wants to schedule maintenance against has actually
  been inspected/registered, whether a batch it wants to coordinate a
  shipment against has actually been QC-verified/registered, whether
  a maintenance proposal secretly tries to FINALIZE (rather than
  merely draft-schedule) a cutting/molding/weaving-line run, whether a
  shipment proposal's own claimed unit count would blow through the
  batch's own logged production unit count, or when an act stops
  being a coordination proposal and becomes direct cutting/molding/
  weaving-equipment control, so this MUST be a separate system able to
  *reject* a proposal and fall back to HOLD.

  `:itonami.blueprint/governor` is `:wood-cork-straw-products-shop-
  plant-operations-governor` (see docs/adr/0001-architecture.md).

  Checks below, ALL HARD violations except the confidence/high-stakes
  gate (SOFT -- asks a human to look, and the human may approve):

    1. Request-level propose-only  -- did the CALLER's own request
                                       actually declare `:effect
                                       :propose`? Any other value is a
                                       mis-wired/compromised caller
                                       trying to bypass proposal-only
                                       mode -- HARD, unconditional,
                                       evaluated BEFORE anything else.
    2. Closed op allowlist         -- is `:op` one of the four ops this
                                       actor is authorized to coordinate?
                                       Anything else -- HARD hold.
    3. Closed effect allowlist     -- is the PROPOSAL's own `:effect`
                                       (what would actually commit) one
                                       of the four propose-shaped
                                       effects? A proposal effect
                                       outside this set (e.g. a
                                       hallucinated `:router/actuate` or
                                       `:cutting-molding-line/finalize`)
                                       is the 'direct cutting/molding-
                                       line-equipment control' scope
                                       violation this actor must NEVER
                                       perform -- HARD, PERMANENT,
                                       unconditional.
    4. Cutting/molding-line-
       finalize blocked            -- for `:schedule-maintenance`, does
                                       the proposal's own `:value`
                                       declare `:finalize? true`?
                                       Finalizing a cutting/molding/
                                       weaving-line run is this actor's
                                       other permanent scope boundary
                                       (see README `What this actor
                                       does NOT do`) -- HARD, PERMANENT,
                                       unconditional. NO phase and NO
                                       human approval can ever override
                                       this (see `woodcork.phase`: this
                                       op is never a member of any
                                       phase's `:auto` set either --
                                       two independent layers agree).
    5. Equipment not verified/
       registered                  -- for `:schedule-maintenance`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY verify the
                                       referenced equipment's own
                                       `:verified?` AND `:registered?`
                                       are both true
                                       (`woodcork.registry/
                                       equipment-ready?`) -- never
                                       trust the advisor's own rationale
                                       about verification/registration
                                       status. Grounded in this
                                       blueprint's own HARD invariant
                                       ('shop/batch record must be
                                       independently verified/
                                       registered before any action'):
                                       maintenance must never be
                                       scheduled against equipment
                                       whose own conditions have not
                                       actually been inspected or
                                       whose registration is not
                                       actually on file.
    6. Already scheduled           -- for `:schedule-maintenance`,
                                       refuses to schedule the SAME
                                       maintenance record twice, off a
                                       dedicated `:scheduled?` fact
                                       (never a `:status` value).
    7. Batch not verified/
       registered                  -- for `:coordinate-shipment`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY verify the
                                       referenced batch's own
                                       `:verified?` AND `:registered?`
                                       are both true
                                       (`woodcork.registry/batch-
                                       ready?`) -- never trust the
                                       advisor's own rationale. Also
                                       part of the 'shop/batch record'
                                       HARD invariant: a batch's own
                                       verified/registered status is as
                                       much a ground-truth fact as an
                                       equipment unit's own.
    8. Shipment unit count
       exceeded                     -- for `:coordinate-shipment`,
                                       INDEPENDENTLY recompute whether
                                       the batch's own recorded
                                       `:shipped-unit-count` plus the
                                       proposal's own claimed
                                       `:unit-count` would exceed the
                                       batch's own recorded
                                       `:unit-count`
                                       (`woodcork.registry/
                                       shipment-unit-count-exceeded?`)
                                       -- ground truth from the
                                       batch's own permanent fields,
                                       never a self-reported unit-count
                                       claim.
    9. Invalid product spec        -- for `:log-production-batch`, if
                                       the patch declares a
                                       `:product-spec` outside the
                                       closed known set
                                       (`woodcork.registry/
                                       product-spec-valid?`), the
                                       batch record is rejected rather
                                       than let a fabricated product
                                       spec through.
   10. Invalid output-quality      -- for `:log-production-batch`, if
                                       the patch declares an
                                       `:output-quality-percent` that
                                       is not a physically plausible
                                       reading

                                       batch record is rejected rather

                                       data through.
